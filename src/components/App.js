                    time, so that a single group only spans a given duration (e.g., 5 minutes), even
                    if it was the same sender for all of the chats.

                    To control the duration length, set `maxGroupDuration` to the number of seconds
                    that a group can span.

                    of using the `renderGroup` property.
